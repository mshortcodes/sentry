## About

Sentry is a terminal-based password manager. I enjoy CLI tools and working in the terminal in general. I also use password managers regularly and recently completed the cryptography course on Boot.dev so I thought this would be a good project to work on.

Sentry is fast, uses a SQLite database, supports multiple users, encrypts passwords, and implements a cache. This was the first project I had done completely in Neovim which was an additional fun challenge.

Key concepts:

- Encryption
- Hashing
- Authentication
- Caching
- Writing SQL queries
- CRUD operations
- Input parsing/validation
